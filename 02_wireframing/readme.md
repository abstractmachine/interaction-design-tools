## Wireframing/Diagrams
One of the fastest ways to get started designing app-based or web-based interactions is to make a wireframe diagram of the flow of interactions.

### Miro
We use Miro to collaboratively flesh out ideas, make mindmaps, write story trees, design website navigation, and all sorts of other things.

### Figma
Figma is one of many possible tools you can use to make interactive wireframes of an app or website. [XD](https://www.adobe.com/fr/products/xd.html) is another option.

### Bravo
By adding Bravo into the mix, you can convert your Figma prototype into an actual working app that you can install onto your phone.

Note: I have not tested this solution sufficiently to recommend it.
