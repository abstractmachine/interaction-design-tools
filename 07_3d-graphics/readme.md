## 3D Modelling

## Unity
Unity is a "game engine", used for making 3D games or interactive experiences in general. Unity projects can be distributed on Mac, PC, Linux, Web, iOS, iPadOS, Android, Switch, Playstation, & XBox. It is the de-facto standard for AR, and is the dominant player in the world of VR. It's closest competitor is the Unreal Engine, or the more modest open-source project Godot.

Start by creating a free account on the Unity website:

<https://id.unity.com/account/new>

You can use any one of the free tiers, either student or free. There is no need for you to sign up for a "pro" account.

Always install whichever version of Unity you prefer via the "Unity Hub".

<https://unity3d.com/fr/get-unity/download>

Important: **Ignore the "Choose your version of Unity" button** and instead install your preferred version of Unity directy from within this "Unity Hub". It will allow you to add and/or remove the various (large) components of your Unity installation at a later date, depending on the platform(s) you are targetting.

Open Unity Hub on your computer and login to your account. From this hub, download the latest `LTS` version of Unity. `LTS` is the "Long Term Support" version of Unity and will last for at least two-years, i.e. the length of a masters programme. Currently we are using Unity 2020.3.x. The last number is just bug fixes and is compatible with any other 2020.3.x release.

*Special note:* constantly, always, without fail, someone will ask: "Isn't Unreal better than Unity?", "I read that Unreal is better than Unity", or "But I saw this YouTube video that says...", and so on. So: *tell me*, is it better? Yes, if you insist. But also: no, it isn't. Or, maybe. Or, whatever. Ask someone else. It's usually the wrong question. Unreal is not "better". It is "different", even if there is an overlap and they are definitely competitors. Unreal is awesome for cinematic immersive 3D world explorations. The latest Meta Human stuff is incredible, but [Character Creator](https://www.reallusion.com/character-creator/) works with Unity, so maybe it isn't that incredible after all. We'll see. Again, wrong question. Some people think it's easier to learn Unreal; many people think it's actually harder. All those people are right or wrong, depending on who you ask. We use Uniy for a bunch of stuff Unreal doesn't doesn't do as well. Does that make Unity better than Unreal? No. Next question. *What? You want a better answer? Hmmmm…* Unity is ok to good for *some* of the things Unreal does really well, but is usually better for our needs because it does everything else, especially if you want to make 2D interactive games or experiences. But for 2D game design you can find a gazillion other alternatives. And there is always Godot, and even the cool 2D-oriented [P5.Play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) plugin for P5 by none other than the amazingly-awesome [Molleindustria](http://www.molleindustria.org). So, final word: I don't know. Maybe you should ask better questions.

### Unreal 5
If you are looking to make the next Mandalorian — i.e. you are working on a [virtual set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjb-AqMD-a4) — or you want really high-end graphics for an interactive installation where you can control the quality of the hardware you will be using to render your game/experience/installation/performance, then the Unreal 5 is looking to be the ultimate high-end game engine over the next cycle of 3D hardware.

Unreal has a visual system for designing the behavior of your game experience called [Blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/). It allows you to code your experience using a node based system of blocks, sililar to Max/MSP, Blender, vvvv, PureData, or TouchDesigner. Alternatively, you can code the behavior of your project using a code-based solution, in the C++ language.

The Unreal 5 interface looks like it will be a lot easier to teach for beginners. That said, beware: Unreal is a big tool, like Unity, and you will not be up and running as fast as you would probably like.

### Cinema 4D
We use Cinema 4D for creating speculative scenarios, world building, and exploring narrative through 3D. It is **not** the ideal tool for CAD-style design of physical objects (cf. below).

There is a very affordable a "teacher & student" licence for Cinema 4D:

If you are already an expert in some other "animation" or "game design" oriented 3D tool such as Blender (cf. below), Maya, 3DS Max, etc., you can stick with that tool. There are many ways to make 3D.

### Blender
Blender is a free, open-source alternative to Cinema 4D, and is currently the rising platform for all things animation/game 3D. It is **not** the ideal tool for CAD-style design of physical objects (cf. below). If you know Maya (another 3d modelling tool) inside and out, and you're happy with it, good for you — stick with Maya. If you don't, and you want to learn all the basic tools of asset creation for games, along with rigging tools, texture mapping, etc., just hunker down and learn Blender:
