## Electronics

### Arduino
Arduino allows you to create interactions with the physical world. It is *the* starting point for most interaction desginers learning to make reactive physical objects or experiences.

You should always have an Arduino Uno or an Arduino Leonardo at your disposal, along with a basic set of core electronics such as a breadboard, wires for prototyping, buttons, LEDs and a servomotor or two.

- [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3)

There are many starter kits containing everything you need to get started (circuit + electronic components):

Arduino is simple software, so great for beginners. But you can also use VS Code (cf. above) to code your Arduino projects:

If you already feel comfortable with the Arduino platform, and wish to have access to more advanced features such as wifi or bluetooth, you can opt instead for an ESP32-based microcontroller:

[ESP-32 Microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32)

There is a really cool and really cheap all-in-one ESP32-based microcontroller called the TTGO T-Display that integrates an Arduino-programmable circuit with a tiny LCD screen, bluetooth and wifi connection, as well as an integrated connector for rechargeable lipo batteries that can be recharged via an integrated USB-C connector. In other words, you can build an entire portable Game & Watch style console via this solution that costs somewhere around 10 CHF:

### Fritzing
Yes, you can design your own circuitboards. You can even integrate them into your own custom housings (cf. CAD Tools, below) that you print out using various prototyping methods.

[Fritzing](https://fritzing.org) is a simple, easy to learn software tool for creating your own custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) designs.

### KiCAD
This is an open-source project slowly emerging as the de-facto hobbyist+professional tool for designing Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). It requires a strong understanding of electronics, and is very much the professional upgrade from Fritzing (cf. above). Another solution is Fusion 360 (cf. below) that integrates a PCB design environment inside of a larger 3D CAD tool.
