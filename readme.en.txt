Title: Interaction Design Tools

----

Intro:

This is a list of some of the basic tools that any student of interaction design should have access to. This is very much a work-in-progress document and was principally designed for my students and colleagues at the [Master Media Design](https://www.hesge.ch/head/formations-recherche/master-en-media-design) and the needs of the larger community at the [HEAD – Genève](https://www.hesge.ch/head).
