## Languages

## HTML/CSS
Webpage design is usually the starting point for many designers just learning to code. Although it has some "programming language" aspects, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is more of a description of layout, typography, and other design choices of a webpage. Basically, HTML describes the content and the structure of that content, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describes the visual design of the page (layout, typography, color, et c√¶tera) and also can be used to interactively animate elements on the page.

Although HTML and CSS were designed principally for publishing websites, there are aspects of CSS that were designed for print-based solutions. In other words, you can design your page to look one way when viewed through a browser, and entirely differently when printed or exported as a PDF, including handling of page breaks and other print-specific design choices. In the Media Design Master, many of us use a combination of Markdown (cf. below) + CSS + Pandoc as a replacement for designing a book or multipage document in InDesign.

Since we do a lot of A.I. experiments, be sure you have the following base Python packages installed:

- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip?hl=fr)

## C#

C# is a language designed by Microsoft, and is used in many different fields; but for our uses is almost solely used in projects built in Unity (cf. below).
